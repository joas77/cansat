APPlication layer
=================

This is a folder for the main application files to be compiled and run.

The next folders are MCL & SDA which stand for Microcontroller Level Layer & Software Driver Application Layer.
Each store the main drivers and uC abstraction layers for the proyect. As I'm using Arduino, many of these steps can be omitted.
